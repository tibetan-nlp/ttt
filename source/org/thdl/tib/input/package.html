Provides classes and methods for inputting and converting to and from
Tibetan text.
<p>
Designed for use with the Tibetan Computer Company's free
cross-platform Tibetan Machine Web fonts, this package contains
methods for inputting Tibetan using various keyboard input methods,
including true Wylie-based input, as well as user-defined keyboards.
<p>
The package includes a simple Tibetan text editor, Jskad, which can be
run as an local application or embedded in a web page.&nbsp; Jskad
supports a wide range of functions, including conversion back and
forth between Tibetan Machine Web and Extended Wylie.
<p>
Also included is TMW_RTF_TO_THDL_WYLIE, a command-line utility for
converting Rich Text Format (RTF)a documents that use the Tibetan
Machine Web fonts into Extended Wylie.&nbsp; This utility is aware of
quirks in Java Swing's RTF support and works around them.
