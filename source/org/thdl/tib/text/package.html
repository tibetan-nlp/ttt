Provides classes and methods for dealing with Tibetan text.
<p>
Designed for use with the Tibetan Computer Company's free
cross-platform TibetanMachineWeb fonts, this package contains methods
for getting the Extended Wylie correspondences for each
TibetanMachineWeb glyph, and for convert back and forth between
Extended Wylie and TibetanMachineWeb.  The TMW to Wylie conversion is
perfect, but the Wylie to TMW is flawed, so use the code in package
org.thdl.tib.text.ttt instead for serious work.  The Wylie to TMW here
is more like a keyboard than a real Wylie to TMW conversion.
<p>
This package provides a variety of ways to store TibetanMachineWeb data,
and includes methods to aid programmers who want to convert from
Extended Wylie to HTML or other formats.
<p>
Here, you can also find methods for installing and managing Tibetan
keyboards. Four keyboards have been provided in this release,
but users may also create their own keyboards.
