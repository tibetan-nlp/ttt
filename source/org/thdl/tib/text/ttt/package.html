Provides classes and methods for converting Latin transliteration of
Tibetan text into Tibetan.
<p>
This package (whose name, ttt, stands for transliteration-to-Tibetan)
contains methods for converting ACIP transliteration into Tibetan
Machine Web and methods for converting EWTS transliteration into
Tibetan Machine Web.&nbsp; It has extensive tests, though probably not
mentioned in these Javadoc documents.
</p>
<p>
When you see the term &quot;Sanskrit&quot; used here, it often means
non-native (not native Tibetan, in other words) rather than truly
Tibetanized Sanskrit.&nbsp; It is overloaded to refer to Tibetanized
Chinese, Tibetanized Sanskrit, etc.
