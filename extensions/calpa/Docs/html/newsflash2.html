<P><FONT size=-1>Washington Tues 9th 2001: Former Microsoft executive
Ima Lyer this afternoon surprisingly retracted his earlier claims that Microsoft
chairman William Gates and Sun Microsytems chief Scott McNealy conspired
to create a duopoly within the software marketplace.

<P>Speaking from the footsteps of his new $25 million private jet which was about
to whisk him away to his new luxury island retreat in the Caribbean, Mr. Lyer
said that he had been overworking recently and this had led him to make
"spurious and unsupportable claims" about the two industry leaders.
