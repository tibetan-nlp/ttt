<H2 align=center>Sun claims HotSpot JIT 'almost ready'</H2>


<P><FONT size=-1>Palo Alto Tues 9th 2001: In a presentation to assembled
computer journalists this morning, Sun Microsystems executives announced
that the eagerly-awaited HotSpot Just-In-Time compiler was on the verge of
being released.
<P>
"There are just a few last minute problems to clear and then we'll be
shipping," said a confident Dan Pinocchio, leader of the HotSpot design team.
<P>
Details also emerged of the hardware that will be required to run the HotSpot
package, which Sun officials claim will enable Java applications to run at up
to ten times their normal speed.
<P>
"You can run HotSpot on a 500Mhz PIII, but you won't see much of a boost,"
Pinocchio explained. "We've found the best performance uplift comes when you
combine HotSpot with one of the new Cray XMP6 PC accelerator cards. Okay,
they cost $25,000, but you should see Java fly...".
<P>
Asked to be a little more specific about a release date, marketing
vice-president Jerry Vaporware wasn't going to pinned down:
<P>
"I'm not going to make any promises," he told the packed press room. "Our
developers have waited a long time for this and we want to get it right. A
few more ye...excuse me...weeks won't hurt."
