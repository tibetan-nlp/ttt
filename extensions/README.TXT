This directory is where we place third-party JARs of which our
software is a client.  The subdirectory to-be-installed-with-ant/
contains a README file for you, also.

See 'http://thdltools.sf.net/BuildSystems.html' for more info.

Note that we've included JDOM beta 8 for your convenience.  See
jdom-license.txt to understand your generous rights regarding it.
