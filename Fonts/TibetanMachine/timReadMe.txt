DESCRIPTION: This folder contains the files you will need to install
and use the Tibetan Machine True Type font.  The font itself consists
of five (5) files that need to be installed in the system's font
folder, a PDF file containing the font's documentation, and this
ReadMe file.  IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT YOU REALLY WANT THE TIBETAN
MACHINE WEB FONT.  The Tibetan Machine Web font works correctly on
more systems, and it does not differ in appearance from this font in
any way.

INSTALLATION FOR WINDOWS XP: To install the files, open the Control
Panel, select Appearance and Themes, and select Fonts from the "See
Also" section at left.  Select File -> Install New Font.  Navigate to
the directory where you extracted the .ttf files.  Select all 10
files.  Be sure "Copy fonts to Fonts folder" is checked, and press OK.

INSTALLATION FOR OTHER SYSTEMS: To install the files copy them from
the folder to which they were extracted into the system's font folder.
In Windows this generally under Windows/Fonts; on the Mac this is
found in System/Fonts, both paths starting from the hard-drive's root
directory.  The fonts are True Type fonts.

FILE NAMES: There are twelve (12) files contained in this folder:

   FONT FILES (5)
        Timn.ttf
        Tims1.ttf
        Tims2.ttf
        Tims3.ttf
        Tims4.ttf

   DOCUMENTATION FILES (2)
        GPL.txt         -   The license governing your use of this font
        timReadMe.txt   -   This ReadMe file

In addition, surf to http://thdl.org/ and look for the following
document:
    Tibetan Machine Web Documentation   -
        This is a PDF file that contains the original documentation
        for the font, including descriptions of the glyphs and their
        ASCII codes, as well as information on which vowel glyphs are
        used with each consonant glyph or stack glyph. The font
        encodings are included with the manual for Tibetan! 5.1, a
        plug-in for Microsoft Word written by Tony Duff of the Tibetan
        Computer Company and also available for free download from the
        Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library's Digital Media Tools
        site at http://thdl.org/.

TROUBLESHOOTING: If you have difficulty installing or using the font,
first try the Tibetan Machine Web font instead, and if that fails,
visit
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=502516&group_id=61934&func=browse
and submit a support request, or e-mail
thdltools-users@lists.sourceforge.net, a public mailing list for users
of THDL tools.
